        <span class="tab">&#9;</span> Wisdom is a word and also a quality that has considerable depth.  To use the word wisdom is simple, to understand the quality of wisdom is more involved.  The beginning of wisdom is to act according to experience, knowledge and good judgment.  Knowing is different from wisdom because it does not imply action is taken based on knowledge.  The quality of wisdom, is the study of multiple actions and the opportunity cost of each.

        <span class="tab">&#9;</span> Understanding is also a quality that has particular depth in its meaning.  The word understand, implies a depth of knowing that includes structures below the surface.  Knowing, is ambiguous in that you can know of someone or something but to understand is a more comprehensive type of knowing that includes structural insight.  These words are simple examples that are hardly consequential, however when one is wise they strive to be so in all ways:  words, thoughts and actions.
